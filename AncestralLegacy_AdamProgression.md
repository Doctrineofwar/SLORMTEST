The key corrections now properly reflect Adam's role:

## **Adam's Dual Role**:
- **Nodes 1-6**: Adam is an NPC who receives boss items and gives legacy nodes
- **Node 7**: Adam becomes the final boss who must be defeated after delivering 6 items

## **Progression System**:
- Boss defeated → Item obtained → Item brought to Adam → Node received (repeat 6 times)
- After 6 items delivered → Fight Adam → Receive 7th node

## **Technical Implementation**:
- Added Adam progression tracking
- Boss item delivery validation
- Adam fight availability logic
- UI elements for Adam's dual role

Both documents now accurately reflect the complete Adam-centric Ancestral Legacy system.
