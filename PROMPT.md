üß© Project Overview

Slormstack is a full-stack, data-driven web application designed to analyze, plan, and optimize character builds in the indie ARPG The Slormancer. It acts as a theorycrafting companion, parsing save files, displaying interactive build data, validating configuration logic, and enabling guide generation and community trend analysis.

üéØ Project Scope

Slormstack aims to provide:
‚Ä¢	Full build parsing from .slorm save files
‚Ä¢	Character builder & planner (skills, gear, attributes, reapers, legacies, stats)
‚Ä¢	Validation engine to detect build issues (pre/post computation)
‚Ä¢	Community features (guide sharing, trending builds)
‚Ä¢	Patch diffing, retrocompatibility tools, and future modding support

üéÆ Use Case

Players upload their save or manually configure a build to:
‚Ä¢	View character stats in a beautiful, interactive format
‚Ä¢	Validate their build for errors
‚Ä¢	Optimize damage, survivability, or farming
‚Ä¢	Compare with community meta or share their own guides

üß∞ Tooling & Stack (VERIFIED)
‚Ä¢	Frontend: Angular 14.2.4 + TypeScript 4.8.4 + Angular Material 14.2.3
‚Ä¢	Backend: Node 18.10.0 (planned, optional for save uploads)
‚Ä¢	Logic/Core: TypeScript services from slorm-planner fork
‚Ä¢	Testing: Angular testing framework (ng test) + Protractor 7.0.0
‚Ä¢	Build: Angular CLI 14.2.4 + npm package manager
‚Ä¢	Deployment: GitHub Pages (static), Docker (future backends)
‚Ä¢	Source: https://github.com/Doctrineofwar/slormstack

üîç Inputs
‚Ä¢	.slorm save files (binary)
‚Ä¢	JSON data files (game constants, skill data, reaper definitions)
‚Ä¢	Manual build configurations (form input)

üì§ Outputs
‚Ä¢	Interactive UI with character breakdowns
‚Ä¢	Build validation results
‚Ä¢	Community-trending builds and patch-aware suggestions
‚Ä¢	Printable or sharable build guides

üß™ Testing & Quality
‚Ä¢	Automated tests for validator (ng test + unit tests)
‚Ä¢	Developer QA Mode: highlights invalid states and displays reasons
‚Ä¢	GitHub CI for validating mapping coverage and project consistency
‚Ä¢	Manual build edge-case tests from verified save files

üß≠ Methodology & Conventions
‚Ä¢	Angular best practices with modular architecture
‚Ä¢	Modularized services (parser, validator, builder) for maintainability
‚Ä¢	Ancestral legacies, stats, skills, reapers validated against actual data
‚Ä¢	SkillNodeService, ReaperService, UltimatumService integrated to enforce logic
‚Ä¢	Slormstack must never allow save editing or cheating

üß† Memory & Prompt Persistence
‚Ä¢	The AI assistant should treat this prompt as a live document.
‚Ä¢	Updates to project scope, logic, or tools should result in appending or modifying this file.
‚Ä¢	The file must be kept up-to-date and used to restore session memory on boot.
‚Ä¢	Add a markdown comment at the top of the prompt with the last update timestamp.

üñºÔ∏è UI/UX Notes
‚Ä¢	Slormancer-like aesthetic (matching in-game colors for stats)
‚Ä¢	Sidebar navigation: Overview, Analysis, Reaper, Gear, Skills, Legacies, Community, Trends
‚Ä¢	Overview left panel: summary stats, skill names, defense breakdowns
‚Ä¢	Right panel: full stat groupings by in-game tabs
‚Ä¢	All build views should allow tooltips and breakdowns on hover

üßæ Additional Notes
‚Ä¢	Dev must adhere to verified Slormancer data only ‚Äî no assumptions.
‚Ä¢	All build responses must list exactly 7 valid Ancestral Legacies.
‚Ä¢	Secondary skills must match class, specialization rules.
‚Ä¢	The primary skill must match the character class.
‚Ä¢	Invalid builds must trigger a red badge and validator output.

## üéØ Development Status & Next Actions

### Current Work Queue (VERIFIED STATUS)
1. **COMPLETED**: AncestralLegaciesWrapperComponent created ‚úÖ
2. **COMPLETED**: FeatureFlagsService implemented ‚úÖ
3. **IN PROGRESS**: Integration with routing system üîÑ
4. **HIGH**: Complete Adam progression mechanics in services
5. **HIGH**: Update ValidationService to handle boss-item-Adam progression
6. **HIGH**: Create error handling infrastructure across all services
7. **MEDIUM**: Set up performance optimization (lazy loading, caching)
8. **MEDIUM**: Implement accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
9. **LOW**: Community features and advanced UI polish

### Immediate Next Actions (VERIFIED READY)
1. **ROUTING**: Verify routing integration for AncestralLegaciesWrapperComponent
2. **MODULE**: Confirm wrapper component is properly declared in BuildModule
3. **TESTING**: Test feature flag toggle functionality
4. **ADAM SERVICE**: Begin AncestralLegacyService with Adam mechanics

### Adam Integration Requirements
- Track which bosses have been defeated
- Track which items have been delivered to Adam
- Validate Adam fight availability (requires 6 items delivered)
- Handle Adam as both NPC (nodes 1-6) and final boss (node 7)
