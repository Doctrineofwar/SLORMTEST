# 🎯 Slormstack Development Status & Priorities

## 🚀 PROJECT SCOPE CLARIFICATION COMPLETE
**Status**: ✅ **SCOPE DEFINED** - AI-Enhanced Build Analyzer with Community Integration

### **Core Mission Statement**
Transform forked slorm-planner into intelligent build analysis platform:
- **AI Integration**: Real-time build analysis using existing save parsing
- **Community Scraping**: Trending builds, guides, meta insights 
- **Enhanced UI**: Complete redesign optimized for new features
- **Attribution System**: Proper creator credit and source linking

## 📋 CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### ✅ FOUNDATION VERIFIED
- **Framework**: Angular 14.2.4 ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Architecture**: Modular, UI-changeable ✅ VERIFIED
- **Save Parsing**: Existing foundation ready ✅ READY TO ENHANCE
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation of concerns ✅ OPTIMAL FOR CHANGES

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (PRIORITIZED)

#### **Priority 1: Architecture Setup** (This Week)
```bash
# Create new service directories
mkdir -p src/services/analysis
mkdir -p src/services/community
mkdir -p src/interfaces/analysis

# Remove validation-focused files
rm src/services/BuildValidatorService.*
rm AncestralLegacyDataModels.ts
rm AncestralLegacy_AdamProgression.md

#### **Priority 2: Core Services** (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **SaveFileAnalysisService.ts** - Main AI analysis orchestrator
- [ ] **EndgameViabilityService.ts** - Build scoring algorithms
- [ ] **CommunityScraperService.ts** - Web scraping framework
- [ ] **AIContextService.ts** - Knowledge base management

#### **Priority 3: AI Integration** (Week 2-3)
- [ ] AI API integration (OpenAI/Claude selection needed)
- [ ] Build analysis prompts and context
- [ ] Real-time analysis pipeline
- [ ] Optimization suggestion engine

#### **Priority 4: Community Features** (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Reddit r/Slormancer scraper
- [ ] Steam guide scraper
- [ ] YouTube content analyzer
- [ ] Build sharing system with attribution

#### **Priority 5: UI Overhaul** (Week 4-5)
- [ ] New component architecture
- [ ] Modern styling system
- [ ] AI analysis interface
- [ ] Community build browser

#### **Priority 6: Integration & Polish** (Week 5-6)
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS NEEDED
### **Immediate Decisions Required**
1. **AI API Choice**: OpenAI, Claude, or local LLM?
2. **Scraping Storage**: Database vs. cache approach?
3. **UI Framework**: Material, Tailwind, or custom?
4. **Scraping Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or on-demand?

### **Architecture Decisions Made**
- ✅ Keep Angular 14.2.4 foundation
- ✅ Enhance existing save parsing (don't rebuild)
- ✅ Analysis-focused (not validation-focused)
- ✅ Complete UI overhaul planned
- ✅ Modular service architecture
