# ✅ Commit: Phase 2 – Scaling Engine, Loop Detection, Canonical Enforcement

**Date:** 2025-06-19  
**Author:** Slormstack Dev Assistant  
**Scope:** Analysis Engine + Canonical Dataset Infrastructure

---

## 🔧 New Features

### 🧮 StatCalculatorService.ts
- Estimates average skill hit, mana flow per second, and effective health
- Outputs integrated into build reports as `numericalScaling`

### 🔁 TriggerLoopAnalyzer.ts
- Detects clone uptime, retaliation loops, and stable mana loops
- Flags broken or missing trigger chains

---

## 🧱 Canonical Dataset Integration

**New folder:** `src/constants/canonical/`

Contains verified data from game files:
- `skills.json`
- `mastery_nodes.json`
- `ancestral_legacies.json`
- `reapers.json`
- `ultimatums.json`
- `stats.json`
- `attributes.json`

These are now enforced in all validation and analysis logic.

---

## 🔐 BuildValidatorService.ts (Strict Mode)
- Now rejects any unrecognized or hallucinated nodes
- Enforces legacy unlock rules and upgrade tier legality
- Validated `save_1.json` successfully under strict rules

---

## 🧪 Output Files (Tested Against `save_1.json`)

- `/output/build-report.v2.json` – Full structured report
- `/output/build-report.v2.md` – Human-readable version
- Includes new sections:
  - `numericalScaling`
  - `loopSynergies`
  - `canonicalIntegrity`

---

## 🧭 Next Step

⚔️ Begin implementation of `MechanicConflictDetector.ts`  
This will allow detection of:
- Stat → skill mismatches
- Ultimatum logic conflicts
- Gear affix waste or contradiction
